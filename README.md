# Form Builder

Form Builder is a platform/collection of apps for building digital forms by representing them as data.

It uses [JSON](documentation/glossary.md#json-and-json-schema) as its data interchange format and [JSON Schema](documentation/glossary.md#json-schema) to define how to create, validate and process that data.
